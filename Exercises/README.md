`scikit-fuzzy` is a fuzzy logic toolkit for SciPy.

The goals of scikit-fuzzy are:
* To provide the community with a robust toolkit of independently developed and
  implemented fuzzy logic algorithms
* To increase the attractiveness of scientific Python as a valid alternative to
  closed-source options.
