## About <a name = "about"></a>


`scikit-fuzzy` is a fuzzy logic toolkit for SciPy.

The goals of scikit-fuzzy are:
* To provide the community with a robust toolkit of independently developed and
  implemented fuzzy logic algorithms
* To increase the attractiveness of scientific Python as a valid alternative to
  closed-source options.

## Installation <a name = "Installation"></a>

Scikit-Fuzzy depends on

  * [NumPy](https://numpy.org/install/ "NumPy") >= 1.6
  * [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/install.html "SciPy") >= 0.9
  * [NetworkX ](https://pypi.org/project/networkx/1.9.1/ "NetworkX ") >= 1.9

and is available on PyPi! The latest stable release can always be obtained
and installed simply by running

     pip install -U scikit-fuzzy

which will also work to upgrade existing installations to the latest release.


If you prefer to install from source or develop this package, you can fork and
clone this repository then install SciKit-Fuzzy by running

	 python setup.py install

or develop locally by running

	 python setup.py develop


If you prefer, you can use SciKit-Fuzzy without installing by simply exporting
this path to your PYTHONPATH variable.

## Tools <a name = "tools"></a>
These exercises are developed in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/ "Visual Studio Code"), so you must install it.

For the representation of the graphs we use [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/users/installing.html "matplotlib").
```python
pip install -U matplotlib
```
